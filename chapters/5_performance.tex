\chapter{Performance}
\label{ch:performance} % 2000-2500 words

Describe the approaches you have used to evaluate that the solution you have designed in \Cref{ch:design} and executed in \Cref{ch:implementation} actually solves the problem identified in \Cref{ch:introduction}.

While you can discuss unit testing etc. you have carried here a little bit, that is the minimum. You should present data here and discuss that. This might include \emph{e.g.} performance data you have obtained from benchmarks, survey results, or application telemetry / analytics. Tables and graphs displaying this data are good.
