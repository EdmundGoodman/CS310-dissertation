\begin{abstract}
    Rust is a type-safe programming language originally developed by Mozilla in 2010. Since its first release, it has gained a large community of dedicated followers. Designed to be memory safe and have foundations in functional programming, it claims to be highly performant, safe, and provide a robust development toolchain.

    The aim for this project is to take a proxy application, for example from the Mantevo Suite, and translate it from C/C++ to Rust. Both versions should be multi-threaded and should be validated against each other for all inputs. Once this has been achieved, a performance study of both versions of the application would be required, contrasting the translated Rust against the original C/C++.

    An extension to this is to implement a Rust+MPI version of the application, and test this against an equivalent C/C++ version across a large amount of compute nodes.
