\begin{abstract}
    % Rust is a type-safe programming language originally developed by Mozilla in 2010. Since its first release, it has gained a large community of dedicated followers. Designed to be memory safe and have foundations in functional programming, it claims to be highly performant, safe, and provide a robust development toolchain.

    % The aim for this project is to take a proxy application, for example from the Mantevo Suite, and translate it from C/C++ to Rust. Both versions should be multi-threaded and should be validated against each other for all inputs. Once this has been achieved, a performance study of both versions of the application would be required, contrasting the translated Rust against the original C/C++.

    % An extension to this is to implement a Rust+MPI version of the application, and test this against an equivalent C/C++ version across a large amount of compute nodes.

    Rust is a type-safe programming language originally developed by Mozilla in 2010. Since its first release, it has gained a large community of dedicated followers. Designed to be memory safe and have foundations in functional programming, it claims to be highly performant, safe, and provide a robust development toolchain \cite{RustProgrammingLanguage}.

    The Mantevo Suite \cite{heroux2013mantevo} is a collection of mini-apps, small software codebases with performance characteristics representative of full-scale applications. Traditionally, mini-apps are used for hardware-software co-design -- allowing simple but accurate estimates of application performance on hardware. However, they can also be used to assess the software stack they are run on, for example

    This project assesses the viability of and workflows for Rust translations of HPC codebases in the context of HPCCG, ``the original Mantevo mini-app'' \cite{MantevoHPCCG2023}. We present a Rust implementation of the HPCCG, showing the possibility of both shared and distributed memory parallelism in Rust using Rayon and MPI, along with a workflow for translation including a novel tool for equivalence checking between Rust and C++. We further present a performance analysis within a novel framework empowering reproducibility, which empirically shows Rust closely trails C++ in performance on real-world applications. We conclude that Rust is a viable language for High-Performance Computing applications, as despite its performance closely trailing C++, it provides commensurate benefits in developer productivity through its compiler guarantees of memory and thread safety, along with its robust toolchain.
