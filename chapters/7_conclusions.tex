In conclusion, this project assesses Rust as suitable for performant and productive implementations of \acrshort{HPC} codebases on the basis of three major factors.

Firstly, \Cref{ch:translation} shows that it is possible to translate non-trivial existing codebases representative of \acrshort{HPC} workloads from C++ into Rust, including leveraging both shared and distributed memory parallelism through Rust's \texttt{rayon} and \texttt{mpi} libraries. It further shows that these translations provide significant benefits to developer productivity. These include reduced effort spent debugging as a result of memory and concurrency safety guarantees and the rich type system, along with quantitative models of productivity suggesting only $0.6 \times$ the total cost is required to complete develop a codebase with equivalent functionality leveraging both shared and distributed memory parallelism in Rust.

Kokkos is a widely used performance portability framework that allows developers to write code which is portable across many hardware architectures, improving developer productivity. However, it is reported to exhibit a $1.11 \times$ slow-down on some representative workloads in \acrshort{HPC} \cite{carteredwardsKokkosEnablingManycore2014}. This provides a real-world example of developer productivity in \acrshort{HPC} being valued over a slight decrease in performance, motivating the suitability of Rust as a result of a similar trade-off.

Secondly, \Cref{ch:performance} shows that the performance of Rust translations of non-trivial C++ codebases approaches their reference implementations, with at worst around a $1.5 \times$ slow-down incurred across parallelism strategies. This measured slow-down concurs with existing literature, such as Moran and Bull's ``Emerging Technologies: Rust in HPC'' \cite{moranEmergingTechnologiesRust2023}, and shows that it extends to larger codebases which leverage distributed memory parallelism. This slow-down is likely because the dominant kernel in \acrshort{HPCCG}, sparse matrix-vector multiplication, is currently less amenable to optimisation by the Rust compiler than the C++ compiler. Since this kernel is very common in \acrshort{HPC}, this impacts its suitability for these workloads. However, other literature such as Constanzo et al. \cite{costanzoPerformanceVsProgramming2021} examining kernels less specific to \acrshort{HPC}, such as the N-body problem, find that Rust is equally performant in these cases. In addition to this, the Rust translations exhibit similar strong and weak scaling properties to the original C++ implementations, demonstrating Rust's capability to scale to the extent required for \acrshort{HPC} workloads.

These first two factors can be interpreted together by plotting a graph comparing the empirical performance and estimated productivity of the C++ and Rust implementations of the \acrshort{HPCCG} \acrshort{mini-app} for each of the parallelism approaches, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:conclusions_performance_productivity}. This figure visualises the result that C++ offers fair performance gains over Rust, but that development using Rust may improve developer productivity.

The final factor which impacts the conclusion is that the performance, productivity, and interoperability of Rust is likely to improve faster than for C++. This is because it is a relatively young language, whose package ecosystem and optimising compilers are yet to reach maturity. As a result of this, there is likely more scope for improvement and less technical debt than with C++, facilitating a faster rate of improvement. This can be enhanced by development of tooling and methodologies to facilitate building and testing Rust programs, such as the proposed novel approach to mitigate issues within translation and the HPC MultiBench tool to facilitate reproducible performance analysis.

These factors taken in combination demonstrate Rust's suitability for \acrshort{HPC} applications, as despite its performance not matching C++ for the measured computational kernels, it provides commensurate benefits in developer productivity such as its compiler guarantees of memory and thread safety.


\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future-work}

Firstly, the author aims to submit a paper derived from this project to the \acrfull{P3HPC} 2024 workshop, as a result of the three novel contributions made over the course of the project.

In addition to this, whilst \acrshort{HPCCG} is around an order of magnitude longer than any of the Rust codebases examined in existing literature, it is one of the shortest \acrshort{mini-app}s in the Mantevo suite. Furthermore, although \acrshort{HPCCG} is ``the original Mantevo mini-app'', other \acrshort{mini-app}s in the suite are more influential and commonly used. As a result of this, one avenue for future work is translating and analysing a longer, more influential \acrshort{mini-app}, for example MiniMD \cite{osti_1231191} or HPCG \cite{dongarra2015hpcg}.

Finally, equivalence checking is a very broad and complex field. As such, future work could easily be derived from this section. For example, a framework implementing the proof-of-concept approach leveraging \texttt{autocxx} as part of a translation methodology could be developed. For example, a crate using Rust macros for ergonomic multiplexing between C++ and Rust function calls could be created for this purpose. In addition to this, comparison of generated \acrshort{LLVM IR} for equivalence checking was dropped as out of scope for this project, but could still yield fruitful research.

% In addition to this, publicising and maintaining open source tools requires a lot of effort from developers. To maximise the impact of the HPC MultiBench, a final possible avenue of future work is making it easily accessible, including publishing it on to the Python Package Repository, and responding to bug and feature requests raised on GitHub.


\section{Author's Assessment of the Project}
\label{sec:reflection}

On reflection, I am immensely proud of the work I have completed in the course of this project. The project was a success, as it achieved all of its ``Must have'' and ``Should have'' objectives, shown in Appendix \ref{sec:project-requirements}. These include translating, equivalence checking, and undertaking a performance analysis of a \acrshort{HPC} \acrshort{mini-app} across serial, shared memory, and distributed memory parallelism approaches.

As discussed in section \ref{sec:future-work}, the project has some limitations which could be addressed by future work, including translating a larger \acrshort{mini-app}, or further investigating equivalence checking methodologies. However, I believe that, even without these, the project is composed of a large technical contribution and draws strong conclusions on the topic, even extending existing literature.

One example of such technical contributions resulted from my choice to extend the project by building tooling to facilitate performance measurements on \acrshort{HPC} resources using Slurm, which was encouraged by incredibly helpful conversations with my supervisor. I found this very fulfilling, as I personally enjoy building tooling which can improve difficult processes in the real world. In my opinion, this is one of the stand-out aspects of this project, as it not only was it incredibly helpful during my performance analysis, but can also be used as an open source software product going forward. I believe it stands on its own as a helpful utility for engineers working in \acrshort{HPC}, as validated by the industry review.

Finally, I believe that this project extends existing literature on the topic to a meaningful degree, making three novel contributions to the field. Firstly, it provides a translation of an application which is both around an order of magnitude longer than the largest existing work, and more representative of common \acrshort{HPC} workloads. Secondly, it provides an assessment which is broader in scope than those in existing literature, including distributed memory parallelism with MPI, and leveraging sophisticated techniques such as roofline models and strong and weak scaling analyses. Thirdly, it proposes both a novel approach and novel tool to mitigate issues within translation and reproducible performance analysis, making future work in the field easier to undertake.

% In addition to this, two ``Could have'' objectives relating to the equivalence checking were dropped, which allowed time for the development of tooling for reproducibly running and aggregating performance experiments. This tool facilitated deep performance analysis of the \acrshort{HPCCG} translation, but also stands on its own as a helpful utility for engineers working in High-Performance Computing, as validated by the industry review.

% This is too negative
% Coming in to the project, I did not have a good way to estimate how long translation tasks, so generously scheduled time in my project specification to undertake these tasks. It transpired that I was able to complete the translation of the serial and parallel implementations faster than expected, which allowed me to focus on the stretch goals of the project. The initially planned stretch goal was extending the translation effort to include an assessment of the Rust bindings to MPI. This presented an interesting technical challenge of using complex Rust structures within an API which does not exactly map to the C++ implementation of the MPI specification.

\section{Open source work}
\label{sec:open-source-work}

% The open source community is critical in publishing and maintaining much of the infrastructure powering the modern world. In the course of this project, I developed a number of open source contributions.

Due to the departmental regulations on open source contributions, the vast majority of open source contributions developed during this project are currently embargoed in private repositories, which will then be made public after the assessment phase of the project has completed. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, which were made with supervisor approval.

\subsection{Contributions already released}
\label{ssec:open-source-already-released}

Firstly, when developing the novel equivalence checking approach leveraging foreign-function interfaces in Rust with \texttt{autocxx}, I needed to invoke functions using array parameters. There was an open issue (\url{https://github.com/google/autocxx/issues/989}) on the project stating that some support for arrays had recently been added, but that this functionality was untested. To resolve this, I pull requested integration tests for this functionality (\url{https://github.com/google/autocxx/issues/989}, shown in Appendix \ref{sec:autocxx-pull-request-appendix}), which confirms its correctness and prevent regression in future.

This pull request has since been merged into the main branch of this repository, and as such will be included in the next release of the \texttt{autocxx} tool. Since this functionality is very common in High-Performance Applications, this confirmation of support unblocks applying this technique in future work

Secondly, during the initial \acrshort{mini-app} identification phase of the project, I noticed that some of the links on the UK-MAC website were broken. As a result of this, I raised a GitHub issue for this (\url{https://github.com/UK-MAC/uk-mac.github.com/issues/1}), and then made a pull request to fix these links (\url{https://github.com/UK-MAC/uk-mac.github.com/pull/2}). This pull request has since been merged, and the website now works correctly.

Finally, I made a pull request into the \acrshort{HPCCG} repository to add Doxygen-style docstrings to the \acrshort{mini-app}, based on the understanding that I gained during the translation process (\url{https://github.com/Mantevo/HPCCG/pull/5}). However, since this project was last actively developed seven years ago, this pull request has not been reviewed nor merged.

\subsection{Contributions to be released}
\label{ssec:open-source-to-be-released}

Firstly, the HPC MultiBench tool repository will be made public, and published on PyPI so it can be installed using the \texttt{pip} package manager.
